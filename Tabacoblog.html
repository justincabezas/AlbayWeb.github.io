                <h2>Tabaco City, Albay | Bicol’s City of Love</h2>

                    For all its friendliness, quaint town romance & encompassing acceptance of the diversity of humankind, Tabaco City prides itself as Bicol’s City of Love. Here, this affection is as hot as its chili, as easy breezy as its beaches & its people are heartwarming as you can imagine.I have to admit that it wasn’t love at first sight. My first visit here was in 2011 for a quick run at work. Then it was seconded by a spontaneous detour when I did a crosscountry roadtrip in 2017. And in the summer of 2018, I just let it slip through the night before sailing to Catanduanes early the next day.After a few failed attempts to experience Tabaco City, I finally got the chance to feel its real vibe when I got invited to the celebration of its town fiesta. This time, I had an entire week to indulge on so many wonderful things that I missed out on in the past.The weeks leading up to June 24 are always a great time to visit Tabaco City as it stages Tabak Festival & the feast of St. John the Baptist. It celebrates the ingenuity of tabak making or bolo smithing as one of its prime local crafts.This merrymaking rejoices many things Tabaceño: their adoration for St. John, its bountiful harvests as well as the charms of its crafts. Also, it celebrates its people’s skills, talents & beauty that make them proud as Bicolanos.Admirably, this festival gives every group in their community a time to shine in various variety shows. There’s one for LGBTQI, for LGU employees, for hip-hoppers & cosplayers. Then there are events for farmers, fisherfolks, bladesmiths & even teenage moms too.One thing that fascinates me about Tabaco City is its abounding view of Mayon Volcano. And, I highly toss this place as one of the best spots to catch her elusive beauty. I surely had a fantastic week waking up to her allure from my hotel’s window.I chased her from the sea, at the plaza & from the road. Even hunted her from fields to farms & from islands to highlands. She’s just so all around that makes the town naturally spectacular.And if you can’t really get enough of her from a panoramic distance, you can scale up to Mayon Planetarium & Science Park in Buang. Saddling at 2,800 feet above, this spot offers not just an observatory facility & museum but also a breathtaking view of this side of Albay.

                <h2>Legazpi City Seawall at Sunrise: Mayon Madness Take 4</h2>

                    It’s a very rare occurrence that I wake up early during my travels. When I went to Legazpi City, however, I couldn’t just pass of the opportunity to view the beautiful sunrise along the coast of Albay Gulf and the clear view of Mayon during the early morning hours. The experience also got me a first hand encounter of everyday activities along the seawall of Legazpi like fishermen waking up early to tend to their catch and joggers, also taking advantage of the cool morning breeze. I went out of Sampaguita Tourist Inn around 5:30AM and rented a tricycle to take me to the seawall section at the foot of Kapuntukan (Sleeping Lion) Hill near Embarcadero de Legazpi. The tricycle driver charged me P60 for the 10-minute one-way trip, which I thought was a rip-off considering that we took the short-cut at highway intersection near Sampaguita Inn. I agreed anyways since I was on a hurry to catch the sunrise. The view of Mayon Volcano was awesome, I’m so happy to have caught a glimpse of its unobstructed beauty once again. Walking along the seawall of Legazpi City, I also had the delight of seeing early morning joggers, photo enthusiasts, and fishermen doing their early morning rounds. It really livens up your spirit to see the beautiful Mayon Volcano when you wake up in the morning.

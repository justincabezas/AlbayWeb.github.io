                <h2>Legazpi City</h2>
                <p>
                    Legazpi, officially the City of Legazpi (Central Bikol: Siyudad nin Legazpi; 
                    Filipino: Lungsod ng Legazpi), is a 1st class component city and capital of the province 
                    of Albay, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 209,533.
                    Legazpi is the regional center and largest city of the Bicol Region, in terms of 
                    population. It is the region's center of tourism, education, health services, 
                    commerce and transportation in the Bicol Region.

                    In 2018, Legazpi was ranked first in overall competitiveness among component cities by 
                    the National Competitiveness Council. The city also ranked first in infrastructure 
                    and second in economic dynamism. In the same year, Legazpi was also named "most 
                    business-friendly city" in the component city category by the Philippine Chamber of 
                    Commerce and Industry.

                    The city of Legazpi was named after Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi, the Basque Spanish 
                    conquistador who officially annexed the Philippine Islands to the Spanish Empire in 
                    1565, and whose surname came from a town in Gipuzkoa, Spain.

                    Legazpi was originally a fishing settlement called Sawangan that occupied the mangrove swamps 
                    that is now the Legazpi Port, inhabited by fisher folk and farmers. In 1569, a Spanish 
                    expedition dispatched by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi led by Luis Enriquez de Guzman and Augustinian 
                    friar Alonso Jimenez first set foot in Albay. They arrived on the coastal settlement called 
                    Ibalon in present-day Magallanes, Sorsogon after exploring the islands of Masbate, Ticao and 
                    Burias and proceeded inland as far as present-day Camalig, Albay.

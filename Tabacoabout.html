                <h2>Tabaco City</h2>
                <p>
                    Tabaco, officially the City of Tabaco (Central Bikol: Siyudad kan Tabaco; Filipino: 
                    Lungsod ng Tabaco), is a 4th class component city in the province of Albay, Philippines. 
                    According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 140,961 people. It is one of the 
                    three component cities of the province, along with Legazpi and Ligao. The mainland part 
                    of the city is bordered by the town of Malinao to the north, the towns of Polangui and 
                    Oas to the west, Ligao to the southwest, Malilipot town to the southeast, and Lagonoy 
                    Gulf to the east. The symmetric Mayon Volcano, the most active volcano in the 
                    Philippines, lies south of the city. Tabaco is one of the eight towns and cities that 
                    share jurisdiction on the volcano, dividing the peak like slices of a pie when viewed 
                    from above.The island of San Miguel, the westernmost of the four main islands in the 
                    Lagonoy Gulf, falls under the jurisdiction of Tabaco. Five of the barangays of the city 
                    are located on the island for a total of 47 barangays composing the city. According to 
                    native stories, the "Legend of Tabaco" was about a lost foreigner who asked the locals 
                    what the name of the place is all about. However a confused and frightened native whom 
                    the lost foreigner asked didn't understand what the lost foreigner was asking. The native 
                    screamed "Tabak ko!" meaning "My bolo" insinuating a person to get his tabak(presumably 
                    for defense). The lost foreigner assumed that the native understood what he asked, then 
                    thought the name of the place is Tabaco.
